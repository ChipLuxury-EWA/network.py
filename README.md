This program is a Trivia game in cli.

In the folder "Python files" you will find 3 python source codes:
1) chatlib.py
2) client_side.py
3) server_side.py

To start the game: first run "server_side.py" this will be the server that let's you play the game.
To enter as a new player run the "client_side.py" and enter name and password, check the server file for the players
data base, and add player as you whish.
To add another player simply run another client.
"chatlib.py" works as a place for the trivia game message protocol and some function for creating messages.
